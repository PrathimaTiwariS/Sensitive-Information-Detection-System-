Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step to understand what each part does:

1. Importing Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import pandas as pd: Imports the pandas library, which is useful for data manipulation and analysis.
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer: Imports the CountVectorizer class from scikit-learn, a tool that converts text documents into a matrix of token (word) counts.
2. Step 1: Load the Data
python
Copy code
file_path = 'keywords.txt'

# Read the file
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
file_path = 'keywords.txt': Specifies the path to the file (keywords.txt) that contains the text data.
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:: Opens the file in read mode ('r') and assigns it to the variable file.
data = file.read(): Reads the entire contents of the file into the variable data as a single string.
3. Step 2: Clean and Process the Data
python
Copy code
# Assuming data is separated by line breaks
# Split the data into lines and remove unnecessary whitespace
lines = data.splitlines()
lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if line.strip() != ""]
lines = data.splitlines(): Splits the data string into a list of lines (each line is a separate element in the list). This method automatically handles different types of line breaks (e.g., \n, \r\n).
lines = [line.strip() for line in lines if line.strip() != ""]: This is a list comprehension that:
line.strip(): Removes any leading or trailing whitespace from each line.
if line.strip() != "": Filters out any empty lines after stripping whitespace.
The result is a list of cleaned, non-empty lines.
4. Step 3: Initialize CountVectorizer
python
Copy code
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(): Creates an instance of CountVectorizer, which will be used to convert the cleaned text data into a Bag of Words (BoW) representation.
5. Step 4: Fit and Transform the Data
python
Copy code
bow_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(lines)
bow_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(lines):
fit_transform(): Combines the fit and transform steps:
fit(): Learns the vocabulary from the list of lines.
transform(): Converts each line into a vector of word counts.
bow_matrix: The resulting matrix is a sparse matrix where each row corresponds to a line from the input, and each column corresponds to a word from the learned vocabulary. The values in the matrix represent the count of each word in each line.
6. Convert to DataFrame for Easy Viewing
python
Copy code
bow_df = pd.DataFrame(bow_matrix.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
bow_df: Creates a pandas DataFrame from the Bag of Words matrix for easier viewing and manipulation.
bow_matrix.toarray(): Converts the sparse matrix into a dense NumPy array, where each row is a document, and each column is a word.
columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out(): Sets the column names of the DataFrame to the words from the vocabulary (the feature names).
7. Show the Result
python
Copy code
print(bow_df)
print(bow_df): Displays the DataFrame, where each row corresponds to a line from the input data, and each column represents a word from the vocabulary. The values in the DataFrame show the count of each word in each line.
Example Output
Assuming your keywords.txt contains the following text:

Copy code
apple banana
banana orange
apple orange orange
The output DataFrame (bow_df) would look something like this:

apple	banana	orange
0	1	1	0
1	0	1	1
2	1	0	2
Each row corresponds to a line from the file.
Each column corresponds to a word from the file.
The values indicate the count of each word in each line.
This matrix representation is a common input format for many machine learning models used in text classification tasks.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer: Imports the CountVectorizer class from scikit-learn, which converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token (word) counts.
2. Defining the Categories
python
Copy code
banking_accounts = [
    "A/C", "account name", "account id", "account limit", "balance", "opening balance",

    "pencil", "quilt", "rainbow", "sand", "tiger", "umbrella", "violin", "whale",
    "xylophone", "yacht", "zebra"
]
Defining Categories: Five different lists of words are defined, each representing a different category (e.g., banking_accounts, banking_transactions). Each list contains strings that represent keywords or terms related to that category.
3. Combining Categories into a Dictionary
python
Copy code
categories = {
    'Banking_Accounts': banking_accounts,
    'Banking_Transactions': banking_transactions,
    'Banking_Identifiers': banking_identifiers,
    'Non_Banking_General': non_banking_general,
    'Non_Banking_Other': non_banking_other
}
Combining Categories: These lists are combined into a dictionary named categories, where the keys are the category names (e.g., 'Banking_Accounts') and the values are the corresponding lists of words. This allows for easy iteration and processing of each category.
4. Step 3: Apply BoW Model to Each Category
python
Copy code
bow_results = {}

for category, words in categories.items():
    # Initialize CountVectorizer
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    
    # Fit and transform the words into BoW
    bow_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(words)
    
    # Convert to DataFrame
    bow_df = pd.DataFrame(bow_matrix.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
    
    # Store the result in a dictionary
    bow_results[category] = bow_df
bow_results = {}: Initializes an empty dictionary to store the Bag of Words (BoW) results for each category.
for category, words in categories.items():: Loops over each category in the categories dictionary. category represents the category name (e.g., 'Banking_Accounts'), and words represents the list of words associated with that category.
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(): Creates an instance of CountVectorizer to convert the list of words into a BoW representation.
bow_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(words):
fit_transform(words): Combines the fit and transform steps:
fit(): Learns the vocabulary from the list of words.
transform(): Converts each word into a vector of counts.
bow_matrix: The resulting matrix is a sparse matrix where each row corresponds to a word from the input list, and each column corresponds to a unique token (word) from the vocabulary. The values in the matrix represent the count of each word.
bow_df = pd.DataFrame(bow_matrix.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()):
Converts the sparse matrix into a dense pandas DataFrame for easier viewing.
bow_matrix.toarray(): Converts the sparse matrix into a dense array.
columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out(): The column names of the DataFrame are set to the tokens learned by the vectorizer.
bow_results[category] = bow_df: Stores the resulting DataFrame in the bow_results dictionary, using the category name as the key.
5. Step 4: Output the Results
python
Copy code
for category, df in bow_results.items():
    print(f"\nCategory: {category}")
    print(df)
for category, df in bow_results.items():: Loops through the bow_results dictionary to print the BoW representation for each category.
print(f"\nCategory: {category}"): Prints the category name.
print(df): Prints the DataFrame that shows the BoW matrix for the corresponding category.
Example Output
For a category like 'Banking_Accounts', the output might look like this:

bash
Copy code
Category: Banking_Accounts
   ac  account  average  balance  closing  id  limit  maintained  name  new  opening  remarks  total

4   0        0        0        0        1   0      0           0     0    0        0        0      0
5   0        0        0        1        0   0      0           0     0    0        1        0      0
6   0        0        0        0        0   0      1           0     0    0        0        0      0
7   0        0        0        1        0   0      0           0     0    0        0        1      0

Each row corresponds to a word from the banking_accounts list.
Each column corresponds to a unique word in the list.
The values indicate the count of each word in each row (since each list item is treated as a single document, these are mostly 1s and 0s).
This output allows you to see how words in each category are represented in a BoW model.

]
Defining Categories: The data is organized into different categories, where each list (e.g., banking_accounts, banking_transactions) represents a different category of keywords related to banking and non-banking topics.
python
Copy code
# Combine the data and labels
data = (banking_accounts + banking_transactions + banking_identifiers + 
        non_banking_general + non_banking_other)

labels = (['Banking_Accounts'] * len(banking_accounts) + 
          ['Banking_Transactions'] * len(banking_transactions) +
          ['Banking_Identifiers'] * len(banking_identifiers) +
          ['Non_Banking_General'] * len(non_banking_general) +
          ['Non_Banking_Other'] * len(non_banking_other))
Combining Data:
data: Concatenates all the category lists into a single list of keywords.
labels: Creates a list of labels, where each label corresponds to the category of the keywords. The labels are repeated according to the number of keywords in each category (e.g., 'Banking_Accounts' is repeated len(banking_accounts) times).
3. Step 2: Vectorization
python
Copy code
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(): Initializes a CountVectorizer object.
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data):
fit_transform(data):
fit(): Learns the vocabulary from the list of keywords in data.
transform(): Converts the list of keywords into a matrix of token counts (BoW representation).
X: A sparse matrix where each row corresponds to a keyword, and each column corresponds to a word from the learned vocabulary. The values in the matrix represent the count of each word in each keyword.
4. Step 3: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
python
Copy code
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42):
X: The matrix of word counts (BoW representation).
labels: The corresponding labels for each keyword.
test_size=0.3: Specifies that 30% of the data will be used for testing, and 70% will be used for training.
random_state=42: Ensures that the data split is reproducible.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test: These variables store the training and testing data and their corresponding labels.
5. Step 4: Train the Random Forest Classifier
python
Copy code
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42):
n_estimators=100: Specifies the number of trees in the forest (100 decision trees will be used).
random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility of the model.
clf.fit(X_train, y_train):
fit(X_train, y_train): Trains the RandomForestClassifier on the training data (X_train) and the corresponding labels (y_train).
6. Step 5: Predict and Evaluate the Model
python
Copy code
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test):
predict(X_test): Uses the trained model to predict the labels for the testing data (X_test).
y_pred: The predicted labels for the testing data.
python
Copy code
# Accuracy Score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(report)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred): Calculates the accuracy of the model, which is the proportion of correct predictions (y_pred) compared to the actual labels (y_test).
accuracy: Stores the accuracy score.
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred):

Result:
The learning curve will show two lines:

Training Score (Red): Typically starts high and may decrease as more training examples are used.
Cross-Validation Score (Green): Typically starts low and increases as more training examples are used, stabilizing as the dataset grows.
By analyzing the gap between these two curves:

If both curves are close and the scores are high: The model is well-fitted.
If there is a large gap: The model might be overfitting (high variance).
If both curves are low: The model might be underfitting (high bias).
This analysis helps determine whether adding more data or tweaking the model would improve performance.

def predict_new_file(file_path, vectorizer, clf):
    # Read the new file
    with open('sens.txt', 'r') as file:
        new_data = file.readlines()
    
    # Preprocess the text (same vectorization as used for training)
    X_new = vectorizer.transform(new_data)

# Example usage (replace 'new_data.txt' with your file path)
predict_new_file('sens.txt', vectorizer, clf)
ChatGPT
This function predict_new_file is designed to predict whether lines of text in a new file are classified as "Sensitive" or "Not Sensitive" based on the trained Random Forest classifier. The function reads the file, processes the text data, predicts the sensitivity using the classifier, and then prints the predictions.

Explanation:
python
Copy code
def predict_new_file(file_path, vectorizer, clf):
file_path: The path to the new file containing the text data.
vectorizer: The CountVectorizer object used to transform the text data into numerical features (same as used during training).
clf: The trained Random Forest classifier used for making predictions.
python
Copy code
# Read the new file
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    new_data = file.readlines()
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:: Opens the specified file in read mode.
new_data = file.readlines(): Reads all the lines from the file into a list called new_data. Each element in the list represents a line of text from the file.
python
Copy code
# Preprocess the text (same vectorization as used for training)
X_new = vectorizer.transform(new_data)
X_new = vectorizer.transform(new_data): Transforms the new text data into the same numerical format (bag-of-words) that was used for training. This ensures that the model can properly interpret the new data.
python
Copy code
# Predict the sensitivity
predictions = clf.predict(X_new)
predictions = clf.predict(X_new): Uses the trained classifier (clf) to predict whether each line of text in X_new is "Sensitive" or "Not Sensitive". The predictions are stored in the predictions array.
python
Copy code
# Print the results
for line, prediction in zip(new_data, predictions):
    print(f"Text: {line.strip()} - Prediction: {prediction}")
for line, prediction in zip(new_data, predictions):: Iterates over each line of text and its corresponding prediction.
line.strip(): Removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the line.
print(f"Text: {line.strip()} - Prediction: {prediction}"): Prints the line of text along with its predicted classification ("Sensitive" or "Not Sensitive").
Example Usage:
To use this function, simply call it with the path to the file you want to analyze, along with the vectorizer and clf that were used during training. For example:

python
Copy code
predict_new_file('sens.txt', vectorizer, clf)
This would read the contents of sens.txt, preprocess them, predict the sensitivity of each line, and print the results.

Note:
Ensure that the file_path you provide correctly points to the file containing the new data.
The text data in the new file should be in a format similar to the training data for accurate predictions.
def classify_document(file_path, vectorizer, clf):
    # Read the entire file content
    with open('sens.txt', 'r') as file:
        document = file.read()
    
    # Preprocess the text (same vectorization as used for training)
    X_new = vectorizer.transform([document])
    
    # Predict the sensitivity of the entire document
    prediction = clf.predict(X_new)[0]
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"The entire document is classified as: {prediction}")

# Example usage (replace 'paras.txt' with your file path)
classify_document('sens.txt', vectorizer, clf)
ChatGPT
The function classify_document is designed to classify the entire content of a document as either "Sensitive" or "Not Sensitive" using a pre-trained Random Forest classifier. Unlike the previous function that processes each line individually, this function treats the entire document as a single input.

Explanation:
python
Copy code
def classify_document(file_path, vectorizer, clf):
file_path: The path to the document you want to classify.
vectorizer: The CountVectorizer object used during training to convert text data into numerical features.
clf: The trained Random Forest classifier used for making predictions.
python
Copy code
# Read the entire file content
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    document = file.read()
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:: Opens the specified file in read mode.
document = file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file into a string called document.
python
Copy code
# Preprocess the text (same vectorization as used for training)
X_new = vectorizer.transform([document])
X_new = vectorizer.transform([document]): Transforms the entire document into a numerical format using the vectorizer. The document is wrapped in a list to keep the input format consistent with the vectorizer’s expectations (which usually processes lists of strings).
python
Copy code
# Predict the sensitivity of the entire document
prediction = clf.predict(X_new)[0]
prediction = clf.predict(X_new)[0]: Uses the trained classifier (clf) to predict the sensitivity of the document. Since the output of predict is an array, [0] is used to extract the single prediction.
python
Copy code
# Print the result
print(f"The entire document is classified as: {prediction}")
print(f"The entire document is classified as: {prediction}"): Prints the classification result, indicating whether the entire document is "Sensitive" or "Not Sensitive".
Example Usage:
To use this function, simply call it with the path to the file you want to classify, along with the vectorizer and clf that were used during training. For example:

python
Copy code
classify_document('sens.txt', vectorizer, clf)
This would read the contents of sens.txt, preprocess the entire document, predict whether the document is "Sensitive" or "Not Sensitive", and print the result.

Note:
Ensure that the file_path you provide correctly points to the file containing the document you want to classify.
This function assumes that the document as a whole can be classified, which may be suitable for situations where the overall content is consistently "Sensitive" or "Not Sensitive". If the document contains mixed content, a line-by-line or paragraph-by-paragraph classification might be more appropriate.

plot_lift_chart(y_test, y_prob)
Function: plot_cumulative_gain
python
Copy code
def plot_cumulative_gain(y_test, y_prob):
This defines a function called plot_cumulative_gain that takes two arguments:
y_test: The true labels of the test dataset.
y_prob: The predicted probabilities for the positive class (in this case, Sensitive).
python
Copy code
    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_prob, pos_label='Sensitive')
The roc_curve function computes the False Positive Rate (FPR), True Positive Rate (TPR), and thresholds to plot the ROC curve. The pos_label specifies which label is considered the positive class.
python
Copy code
    gains = tpr / tpr[-1]
The gains variable calculates the cumulative gain by normalizing the TPR values with the maximum TPR (i.e., the last value of TPR, tpr[-1]). This scales the TPR to represent the cumulative gain as a percentage.
python
Copy code
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
This line initializes a new figure for the plot with a specified size of 8 by 6 inches.
python
Copy code
    plt.plot(np.arange(len(gains)), gains, 'b-', label='Cumulative Gain')
This line plots the cumulative gain curve:
np.arange(len(gains)) generates a range of numbers corresponding to the length of the gains array.
gains is the y-axis data.
'b-' specifies the line color (b for blue) and line style (- for solid line).
label='Cumulative Gain' adds a label to the plot for the legend.
python
Copy code
    plt.plot([0, len(gains)-1], [0, 1], 'k--', label='Random Model')
This line plots a baseline for a random model, which is a straight line from (0, 0) to (len(gains)-1, 1). It serves as a comparison:
[0, len(gains)-1] are the x-axis values.
[0, 1] are the y-axis values.
'k--' specifies the line color (k for black) and line style (-- for dashed line).
label='Random Model' adds a label for the baseline in the legend.
python
Copy code
    plt.xlabel('Percentage of Sample')
    plt.ylabel('Cumulative Gain')
    plt.title('Cumulative Gain Chart')
    plt.legend(loc='lower right')
    plt.show()
These lines configure the plot:
plt.xlabel('Percentage of Sample') sets the x-axis label.
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Gain') sets the y-axis label.
plt.title('Cumulative Gain Chart') sets the title of the plot.
plt.legend(loc='lower right') adds a legend to the plot, positioning it at the lower right corner.
plt.show() displays the plot.
Function: plot_lift_chart
python
Copy code
def plot_lift_chart(y_test, y_prob):
This defines a function called plot_lift_chart that takes two arguments:
y_test: The true labels of the test dataset.
y_prob: The predicted probabilities for the positive class (Sensitive).
python
Copy code
    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_prob, pos_label='Sensitive')
The roc_curve function is used again to compute the FPR, TPR, and thresholds for plotting the ROC curve.
python
Copy code
    gains = tpr / tpr[-1]
gains is calculated in the same way as in plot_cumulative_gain, representing the normalized TPR.
python
Copy code
    lift = gains / (np.arange(len(gains)) / len(gains))
lift is calculated by dividing the cumulative gain by the percentage of the sample size:
np.arange(len(gains)) generates a range of indices.
Dividing by len(gains) converts these indices into a percentage.
The result is an array representing the lift at each point in the dataset.
python
Copy code
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
This line initializes a new figure for the lift plot with a specified size of 8 by 6 inches.
python
Copy code
    plt.plot(np.arange(len(lift)), lift, 'b-', label='Lift')
``]
- This line plots the lift curve:
  - `np.arange(len(lift))` generates a range of numbers corresponding to the length of the `lift` array.
  - `lift` is the y-axis data.
  - `'b-'` specifies the line color (`b` for blue) and line style (`-` for solid line).
  - `label='Lift'` adds a label to the plot for the legend.

```python
    plt.xlabel('Percentage of Sample')
    plt.ylabel('Lift')
    plt.title('Lift Chart')

    plt.show()
These lines configure the plot:
plt.xlabel('Percentage of Sample') sets the x-axis label.
plt.ylabel('Lift') sets the y-axis label.
plt.title('Lift Chart') sets the title of the plot.
plt.legend(loc='lower right') adds a legend to the plot, positioning it at the lower right corner.
plt.show() displays the plot.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
y_prob = clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Probability of the positive class
plot_cumulative_gain(y_test, y_prob)
plot_lift_chart(y_test, y_prob)
This part is an example usage of the functions:
clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] generates the predicted probabilities for the positive class (class 1), using a classifier (clf).
These probabilities are passed to plot_cumulative_gain and plot_lift_chart functions to generate the respective plots.

python
Copy code
    sns.countplot(y)
This line uses seaborn's countplot function to create a bar plot showing the count of each unique class label in y.
sns.countplot(y) automatically counts the occurrences of each unique value in y and creates a bar for each one.
python
Copy code
    plt.xlabel('Class Label')
This sets the label for the x-axis as 'Class Label'.
The x-axis will show the unique class labels from y.
python
Copy code
    plt.ylabel('Count')
This sets the label for the y-axis as 'Count'.
The y-axis will represent the number of occurrences of each class label in y.
python
Copy code
    plt.title('Class Distribution')
This sets the title of the plot as 'Class Distribution'.
python
Copy code
    plt.show()
This line displays the plot on the screen.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
plot_class_distribution(labels)
This is an example of how to use the plot_class_distribution function:
labels is a variable that contains the class labels of a dataset.
The function will create and display a bar plot showing the distribution of these labels (i.e., how many times each label appears in the dataset).
Summary:
The plot_class_distribution function visualizes the distribution of class labels in a dataset.
It uses seaborn's countplot function to create a bar plot, which helps you quickly assess if your dataset is balanced or imbalanced in terms of class labels.
This is important in machine learning as an imbalanced dataset might affect the performance of some models.

Let's break down the plot_validation_curve function line by line.

Function: plot_validation_curve
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve
This imports the validation_curve function from sklearn.model_selection. The validation_curve function is used to evaluate the performance of a model on different values of a specified hyperparameter. It returns the training and cross-validation scores for each value of the hyperparameter.
python
Copy code
def plot_validation_curve(X, y):
This defines a function called plot_validation_curve that takes two arguments:
X: The feature matrix (input data).
y: The target variable (labels).
python
Copy code
    param_range = np.arange(10, 200, 10)
This creates a range of values for the hyperparameter n_estimators of the RandomForestClassifier.
np.arange(10, 200, 10) generates an array of values starting from 10 up to (but not including) 200, with a step size of 10.
These values represent the number of trees in the random forest that the validation curve will evaluate.
python
Copy code
    train_scores, test_scores = validation_curve(
        RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42), X, y, param_name="n_estimators", param_range=param_range,
        cv=5, scoring="accuracy", n_jobs=-1)
This line computes the validation curve:
RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42) creates an instance of the RandomForestClassifier with a fixed random state for reproducibility.
X, y are the input features and labels, respectively.
param_name="n_estimators" specifies that the n_estimators hyperparameter will be varied.
param_range=param_range provides the range of values to be tested for n_estimators.
cv=5 sets the number of folds for cross-validation to 5.
scoring="accuracy" specifies that accuracy will be used to evaluate the model.
n_jobs=-1 uses all available processors to speed up computation.
The function returns train_scores and test_scores, which are arrays containing the scores for each value in param_range during training and cross-validation, respectively.
python
Copy code
    train_scores_mean = np.mean(train_scores, axis=1)
    test_scores_mean = np.mean(test_scores, axis=1)
These lines calculate the mean scores across the cross-validation folds for both training and test data:
train_scores_mean is the mean training accuracy for each value of n_estimators.
test_scores_mean is the mean cross-validation accuracy for each value of n_estimators.
python
Copy code
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
This initializes a new figure for the plot with a specified size of 8 by 6 inches.
python
Copy code

This plots the mean training accuracy against the number of estimators:
param_range is the x-axis data (number of estimators).
train_scores_mean is the y-axis data (mean training accuracy).
label="Training score" adds a label for this line in the legend.
color="r" sets the line color to red.
python
Copy code
    plt.plot(param_range, test_scores_mean, label="Cross-validation score", color="g")
This plots the mean cross-validation accuracy against the number of estimators:
param_range is the x-axis data (number of estimators).
test_scores_mean is the y-axis data (mean cross-validation accuracy).
label="Cross-validation score" adds a label for this line in the legend.
color="g" sets the line color to green.

plt.ylabel('Accuracy') sets the y-axis label to 'Accuracy'.
plt.title('Validation Curve with Random Forest') sets the title of the plot.
plt.legend(loc='best') places the legend in the best location according to the plot layout.
plt.show() displays the plot.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
plot_validation_curve(X, labels)
This is an example of how to use the plot_validation_curve function:
X is the feature matrix, and labels is the target variable (class labels).
The function will generate a plot showing how the accuracy on both the training and cross-validation sets changes as the number of estimators in the RandomForestClassifier is varied.
Summary:
The plot_validation_curve function helps visualize the effect of the n_estimators hyperparameter on the accuracy of a RandomForestClassifier.
By comparing the training and cross-validation accuracy, you can identify whether the model is underfitting, overfitting, or just right for the given range of hyperparameter values.
